# Commit Your Talk - Curriculum

## Philosophy

**Commit Your Talk** is designed specifically for software engineers who want to become confident public speakers. We understand that many developers are introverts who find public speaking daunting. Our curriculum meets you where you are and helps you progress at your own pace.

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Skill Building
Start small with 30-second introductions, gradually building to full conference talks. Each step is achievable and builds on the last.

### 2. Safe Learning Environment
Practice in our Discord community where everyone is supportive and constructive. No judgment, only growth.

### 3. Tech-Focused Content
All examples, exercises, and scenarios are relevant to software engineering. Learn to explain code, present architectures, and demo technical concepts.

### 4. Real-World Application
Every lesson includes practical exercises that mirror real speaking situations: standups, tech talks, interviews, conferences, and leadership presentations.

### 5. Community Feedback
Receive constructive feedback from peers and experienced coaches. Learn from watching others and sharing your experiences.

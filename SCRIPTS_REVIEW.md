- Level 1: Scripts 1.4 and 1.5
- Level 2: Scripts 2.4 and 2.5  
- Level 3: Scripts 3.4 and 3.5

### Option 2: Update scripts.md
If the current 39 scripts in the app are intentional, update `scripts.md` to only include those scripts and renumber accordingly.

### Option 3: Keep Both
Keep all 50 scripts in `scripts.md` as reference material, but only implement the most essential 39 in the application for now.

## Notes
- All scripts in Levels 4-10 are fully implemented ✅
- Only Levels 1-3 are missing scripts
- The missing scripts are all valuable and cover important scenarios
- scripts.md formatting and content are accurate for all 50 scripts
